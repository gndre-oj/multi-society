										Another wave of migration began in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, when many millions of workers from Italy, Spain, Greece, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Portugal, 
										Morocco, Tunisia and South Korea were employed as guest workers in the course of the "economic miracle". 
										A recruitment freeze was imposed in 1973, and the most important immigration option was family reunification.
